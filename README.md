# Bank Loan Report

## Overview

This project is a **Bank Loan Report** dashboard created using **Tableau** for visualization and **SQL** for data extraction and manipulation. The dashboard provides insights into loan distributions, customer demographics, repayment statuses, and other key financial metrics.

## Features

- Interactive visualizations for loan approvals, denials, and repayments.
- Analysis of loan trends based on different parameters (e.g., age, income, credit score, loan amount, etc.).
- Dynamic filters for easy data exploration.
- KPI indicators for quick performance assessment.

## Technologies Used

- **Tableau**: For creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.
- **SQL**: For data extraction, transformation, and analysis.
- **Database**: (Specify the database used, e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.)

## Data Sources

The dataset includes:

- Loan applicant details (age, income, employment status, credit score, etc.).
- Loan details (amount, duration, interest rate, approval status, etc.).
- Repayment history.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- Tableau installed on your system.
- SQL database with access to relevant loan data.

### Steps

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Import the SQL scripts into your database.
3. Load the dataset into Tableau.
4. Connect Tableau to your SQL database.
5. Open the Tableau workbook (.twbx) and explore the visualizations.

## Dashboard Overview

The dashboard consists of multiple sections:

- **Summary View**: Key performance indicators (KPIs) showing total loans, approvals, and defaults.
- **Loan Status Distribution**: Pie chart/bar chart representing the proportion of approved, rejected, and pending loans.
- **Demographic Analysis**: Insights into borrower age, income groups, and credit scores.
- **Repayment Trends**: Line chart showing repayment behavior over time.

## Future Enhancements

- Integrate machine learning models for loan default predictions.
- Add real-time data updates.
